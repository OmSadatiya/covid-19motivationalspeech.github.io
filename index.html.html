Hi I Am Om Sadatiya Of Grade VIIG I Wrote A Speech On Covid-19 Which Is Below <br>
It's become quite clear that COVID-19 doesn't care who you are or how famous you might be. Since early March 2020, many of the biggest names in Hollywood, sports, royalty and politics have contracted the coronavirus. Wonderwall.com rounded up all the bold-faced names who've tested positive for COVID-19, starting with this future king... On Nov. 1, Britain's The Sun tabloid broke the news that Prince William was diagnosed with COVID-19 back in April shortly after his father, Prince Charles, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed they had the illness. However, the Duke of Cambridge decided to keep his diagnosis a secret so as not to further alarm the nation, The Sun and other outlets reported -- a move that's sparked widespread criticism. The newspaper further reported that William received treatment from palace physicians and quarantined away from his family at their Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, England. He got through it but he did have symptoms. "At one stage he was struggling to breathe, so obviously everyone around him was pretty panicked," a source told The Sun. According to a Nov. 2 tweet from Daily Mail royals reporter Rebecca English, Kensington Palace officials "have belatedly confirmed that Prince William did have coronavirus in April - [but] [Duchess] Kate and the children did not. Valid questions as to why this was kept secret, although KP say he didn't want to alarm people after his father's diagnosis."
